This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: having multiple mutable borrows to the same variable.  The code attempts to create two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x`.  This violates Rust's borrowing rules and results in a compile-time error. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by restructuring the code to use only one mutable borrow or by using interior mutability.
